			<li>Great Smokey Mountains</li>
				<img src="images/smokeymountain.jpg" alt="A picture of the Smokey Mountains." class="shift_smokey"  style="float: right" />
				<p> Ensconced at number one is Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which draws more than ten million visitors annually—about twice the number of the second most 
					popular park. Most visitors see the park from a mountain-skimming scenic highway; many take to the more than 800 miles of hiking trails across North Carolina 
					and Tennessee.</p>
		
		
			<li class="padding_canyon">Grand Canyon</li>
				<img src="images/grandcanyon.jpg" alt="A picture of the Grand Canyon."  style="float: left" />
							<p> In 2015, 5.5 million people witnessed the wonders of one of the largest canyons on Earth. A mile deep and up to 18 miles wide at spots, the Grand Canyon is so vast 
								that even from the best vantage point only a fraction of its 277 miles can be seen.</p>
		
				
			<li class="shift_rocky">Rocky Mountain</li>
				<img src="images/rockymountain.jpg" alt="A picture of the Rockey Mountains." style="float: right"/>
				<p> Sweeping vistas are a main attraction at Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. The park contains 150 lakes and 450 miles of streams, plus ecosystems ranging from 
					wetlands to pine forests to montane areas to alpine tundra.</p>
		
					
			<li class="shift_yosemite">Yosemite</li>
				<img src="images/yosemite.jpg" class="rocky" alt="A picture of Yosemite."  style="float: left"/>
				<p> "No temple made with human hands can compete with Yosemite," wrote John Muir, whose crusading led to the creation of the California park in 1890. Over four million visitors 
					come to this temple annually, most of them spending time in the Yosemite Valley. This mile-wide, 7-mile-long canyon was cut by a river and then widened and deepened by 
					glacial action.</p>
		
			
					
			<li class="shift_yellow">Yellow Stone</li>
				<img src="images/yellowstone.jpg" alt="A picture of Yellow Stone." class="float_right" style="float: right" />
				<p> The world's very first national park remains the showpiece of the National Park Service, visited by 4.1 million people last year. The vast reserve—covering 2.2 million acres 
					in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana—has craggy peaks, explosive geysers, alpine lakes, deep forests, and a wealth of wild animals. The stars are bison, bears, sheep, moose, and 
					wolves.</p>
