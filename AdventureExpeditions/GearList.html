				<h1>The Essential Gear List Every Backpacker Must Use</h1>
				
				<p>When backpacking through the National Parks, it is extremely important to come prepared for any circumstance that may occur.
				National Parks are generally very large, much larger than your local hiking spots. Disasters can occur at any moment. Whether you 
				experience an injury on the trail, flash floods and extreme winds, storms of any kind, or simply getting lost on the trail, you will
				be very dependant on the equipment that you brought with you. To be sure you have a pleasant and relaxing experience, here is a list
				of some of the essentials you may want to consider bringing with you on your next adventure.</p>
				
				<h2>Sleeping system</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Tent</li>
						<p>Be sure to pack a light weight easy to setup tent that you have practice setting up before venturing off on your expedition. Depending
						on the season you intend on camping in, you will want a tent that is compatible with the time of year and location. The tent should 
						have a rain-fly to shield you from any rain that may occur as well as window flaps for air circulation. It should also
						be made of a strong material such as ripstop nylon to hold-up on rugged terrain.</p>
					<li>Sleeping Bag</li>
						<p>Your sleeping bag will depend on the season as well. You don`t want to sleep in a sleeping bag made for 20 degree winter nights
						when you are camping in the summer heat, so plan accordingly. Down feather sleeping bags are the lightest but when they get wet they will
						not be very comfortable to sleep in. Synthetic material would be the alternative but they are often much heavier.</p>
					<li>Air Mattress</li>
						<p>After a long and gruelling hike up and down steep mountains and harsh terrain, your body will definitely take a toll.
						Consider bringing a light weight thin air mattress for hiking. This will help you sleep more soundly throughout the night.</p>
				</ul>	
				<h2>Backpack and Clothing</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Backpack</li>
						<p>Your backpack will depend on a few factors: The time and location where you intend on backpacking, how long you intend on camping, 
						and how much ground you intend on covering. With that said, you would not want to pick an expensive 85 Liter backpack for just an hour
						hike. For long expeditions where you intend on covering a lot of ground, you will want a large pack to store all of your food and clothing.
						</p>
					<li>Clothing</li>
						<p>Your clothing should depend on the season too. Backpacking during the warm season will require light weight moisture wicking material that
						won`t get heavy when wet and won`t smell after hours of sweat pouring into them. During the cold season, you will want to layer up so that will
						require more clothing. Stay away from cotton material because it will get heavy when wet and will be unable to keep you warm. Cotton also absorbs 
						sweat so you will have a very smelly time. Consider bringing wool clothing. When wool gets wet, it will still keep the heat in allowing you to stay
						warm.</p>
				</ul>
				<h2>Additional essentials</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Compass</li>
						<p>When you are out hiking unfamiliar terrain, it is vital that you have a means of establishing direction.</p>
					<li>Map</li>
						<p>Along with a compass, you should have a map of the National Park you are backpacking in. Both map and compass should
						complement each other. Be sure to learn how to use both before setting out to your destination.</p>
					<li>Food</li>
						<p>How much food you bring will depend on the same factors mentioned above. Opt for high carb and high protein foods.</p>
					<li>Cooking equipment</li>
						<p>A cooking stove and fuel will be required to boil water and cook any food that needs to be cooked. There are many light weight options.</p>
					<li>Flash light</li>
						<p>It is always good to have a flash light to see the terrain when the sun sets. It can also prove useful when trying to find 
						things deep in your backpack.</p>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Well that should cover most of the essentials needed for a safe and pleasant experience. Try exploring other sites as well and adding to the list but be sure not
				to over pack!</p>
